# full_stack_app_with_react_and_a_rest_api_p10

This is a full stack web project that is built with  React, JSX, React Router, and Create React App.

React will provide the front-end aspect for the REST API I created previously which is a database for a school.

The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information 
about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, 
viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
